# AWS Apache-modules
Assignment Description
Assignment 2 - Apache modules
1) By default, when you browse for Apache ServerName, you get index.html printed in your browser even if you dont mention the file name in URL. Change that behaviour and make default index file as test.html.
2) Configure Apache in such a way that if someone browse for a page in apache (eg: test1.html), their browser redirect them to a different page. (eg: test2.html) (Tip: Use rewrite module in Apache)
3) Enable Password Authentication in Apache, so that when someone browse your website, they get a popup asking them to enter a username and password, before apache will display pages to them on their browser (Tip: use module auth_basic)
